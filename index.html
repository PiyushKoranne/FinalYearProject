<p>I dedicate this website to my parents, mentors and, especially, to the HOD of Electronics and Telecommunications Department, SGSITS for their constant guidance and support. This website is a culmination of all the hard work that went into the design and hands-on approach suggested to me by Prof. Manish Panchal. I sincerely believe that the success is the fabric woven by the threads of persistence and creativity. This website shall be a token of my appreciation towards the department, apart form being the Final Submission of the Project undertaken by me as a student of IIIrd Year Semester-B. I would finally thank my parents for their constant love and support throughout all of my endeavours.

<p>The idea of doing internships to gain hands-on experience is one which fascinated me, since I am a person who learns the best by doing things. I have been ever since pursuing various internship opportunities to hone my skills and develop a robust skillset. Some of my recent internships are linked below.<br><br>
	<b>1. AI/ML Engineer Trainee </b> -<i> Ezeiatech Technologies Gurugram.</i>
		I served as a Machine Learning Trainee, working on review and feedback systems modelling. This has been an endeavour which proved to be very fulfilling. I designed and monitored supervised learning systems and algorithms which were applied to study a mixed linguistic feedback than most companies in India get(i.e a mixture of Hindi and English)<br>
