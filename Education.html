    <p><br>
      The idea of doing internships to gain hands-on experience is one which fascinated me, since I am a person who learns the best by doing things. I have been ever since pursuing various internship opportunities to hone my skills and develop a robust skillset. Some of my recent internships are linked below.
<br><br>
<b>1. AI/ML Engineer Trainee</b> - Ezeiatech Technologies Gurugram. I served as a Machine Learning Trainee, working on review and feedback systems modelling. This has been an endeavour which proved to be very fulfilling. I designed and monitored supervised learning systems and algorithms which were applied to study a mixed linguistic feedback than most companies in India get(i.e a mixture of Hindi and English)<br>
<br>

<b>2. IOT Engineer Trainee</b> - Emorphis Technologies. I served as a trainee engineer in the IOT department of the company. This was indeed a fascinating Learning Experience. I was responsible for making software solutions for reliable, accurate and calibrated data collection and syncing the data with database/servers. During my tenure there, I also engineered a fully functional gesture controlled rover.<br>
