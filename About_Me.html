	<h3>Hello Viewer!</h3>
	<p>
		It has been a firm belief of my life that creativity thrives when one does what he/she loves to do. No matter where. I have been a curious student most of my life. Technology and its impact was something i was quick to notice growing up. I hope this website will act as a testament to the above statement. Warm and sincere regards to anyone who is reading this.

To,<br>
All HR Managers.<br>
<br>
Dear Sir/Ma'am,<br>
Excellence is the fabric woven by threads of Persistence and Creativity. This has been my firm belief throughout my engineering journey. The pace at which life runs should only compel one to run even faster. Because learning is the most crucial aspect of the life of a modern individual, be it learning some complicated process or learning how to write a cover letter. 
<br><br>
After completing my engineering recently, I am filled with optimism and am ready to advance my career by gaining some skills, knowledge and experience while also creating value out of the work I do. I have equipped myself with relevant skills and a learning mindset to face any challenge that may be presented to me. 
<br><br>
All relevant documents have been attached. Hopeful and eager for your response. Thank you for your time and consideration.
<br><br>
Sincerely,<br>
Piyush Koranne
